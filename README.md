ByMI: Byzantine Machine Identification with False Discovery Rate Control. <i>Proceedings of the 41st International Conference on Machine Learning</i>, in <i>Proceedings of Machine Learning Research</i> 235:41357-41382 Available from https://proceedings.mlr.press/v235/qian24b.html.

We provide a solid statistical framework for Byzantine machine identification in distributed/Federated learning with error rate control.

## Instructions to run the experiments
We provide the code of the experiments on real data. The results in the paper can be obtained by running
```
Rscript detect_realdata.R
```
